        "This script illustrates the concept of **inheritance** in OOP\n",
        "Inheritance is a way of creating a new class for using details of an existing class without modifying it. The script also illustrates the concept of **polymorphism** in Python, that allows the same entity (method or operator or object) to perform different operations in different scenarios.\n",
        "\n",
        "In this example we have:\n",
        "* parent class `Tray` with attributes `species`, `number_of_plants` and `is_usable`. The class has a method `is_empty` that returns True or False.\n",
        "* child class `SingleUseTray` inherits from `Tray`. The child class has a method `remove_plants` that returns a list of Plant objects.\n",
        "* child class `MultipleUseTray` inherits from `Tray`. The child class has a different method `remove_plants` that also returns a list of Plant objects\n",
        "\n",
        "Therefore, `remove_plants` is an example of **polymorphism** since this method has a distint functionality in each class.\n",
        "\n",
        "The code ilustrates how `SingleTray` and `MultipleUseTray` can inherit attributes and methods from the parent class:\n",
        "* Attributes `species` and `number_of_plants` are inherited from the parent class.\n",
        "* Methods `__str__` and `is_empty` are also inherited from the parent class.\n",
        "\n",
        "Additional arguments, attributes and methods:\n",
        "* child class `MultipleUseTray` has an additional argument `max_number_of_uses` that is used to limit the number of uses of the tray and is not an attribute of `Tray`\n",
        "* child class `MultipleUseTray` has a new method `add_plants` that adds plants to the tray\n",
        "\n",
        "Each instance of `SingleUseTray` can be used only once, while each instance of `MultipleUseTray` can be used up to `max_number_of_uses` times."
