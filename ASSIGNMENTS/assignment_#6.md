- Sync your Fork (Fetch). If you have commits ahead, contribute first (Pull Request)
- Consider the file "Climate_hisafe_kmnievaluation_..."
- Consider the file "FAO 56.pdf" in our literature folder https://tinyurl.com/29bsu7mm or even section 2.1, page 3 of this report: https://tinyurl.com/w5t9v2d3 
- read section:
  - Vapour Pressure (page 33-40 of the pdf)
  - Focus on Box 7 (page 40) 
- Create a file in your FORGE folder named climate_vpd.py
- In your FORGE/myfunctions.py create another function:
  - called calculate_vpd
  - which is going to calculate Vapour Pressure Deficit according to FAO Report nr 56
- In your climate_vpd.py create code to:
  - Open the file "Climate_hisafe_kmnievaluation_..."
  - Store the climate information at your will (e.g in one list, several lists, explore the module csv, etc) 
  - Remember: You need to avoid reading the header in the calculations
  - Create a new list called lst_vpd
  - Populate the list with the result of your function "calculate_vpd" (Tip: search for the list method append() )
  - Create, in your FORGE/YourName a new file named "Climate_hisafe_kmnievaluation_..._vpd.csv". The result will be a identical file with an extra column with VPD values
- Do the same process to the file "Climate_hisafe_knmircp85_..."
