## ASSIGNMENT #1 - Fork, create a file, commit it, push it, and request a pull
### Difficulty (1-5): 1
- FORK our main repository (https://github.com/isa-ulisboa/greends-ipython) into your account
- CLONE your forked repository into your local machine
- create a new file with your name/nickname in the folder "FORGE", e.g. yourname.py
- Add some simple code you have learned in the class
- Run the program and make sure there is no errors, before commiting (next step)
- go to source control icon on the left icons menu (3rd from top) and add a message "Added my file" and do a COMMIT (press)
- push the commit into the repository. In VS code this is done by clicking on the bottom left icons (the little arrows show how many comits are to push and how many new ones are to pull )
- Press Pull Request on your repository
