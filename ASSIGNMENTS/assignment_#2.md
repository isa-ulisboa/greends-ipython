# ASSIGNMENT #2 - create a new branch on your fork, 
## Difficulty (1-5): 1 
- Keep working on your forked repository
- A branch is like a copy of the project you are branching from, and where you can create you own path for changes (e.g. a new idea/add-in) that later can be merged again into the main project
- create a new branch called YourName1stBranch. Tip: click on bottom left icon (the name of the current branch: "main") and follow logic
- edit your file with a briliant, but small programm in python. For example, make a program similar to what you did in the collaborative environment
- COMMIT your changes (add a short message to your commit, e.g. my first commit)
- PUSH your changes from your branch to the server
- Create PR (Pull Request)
